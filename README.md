# Deep Learning for Real-Time Road Sign Detection and Recognition

*BSc Dissertation Project*

This project implements a real-time traffic sign detection and classification system using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) with a MobileNet V2 backbone. It showcases the practical application of deep learning techniques for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems.

Leveraging TensorFlow’s Python API, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset is processed and reduced from 43 to 13 key classes, focusing on the most frequent and relevant road signs for robust model training and evaluation.
